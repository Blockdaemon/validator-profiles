## Team

Our Founder and CEO, Konstantin Richter, started Blockdaemon with a small team of engineers in the summer of 2017. Since then, we’ve grown to about 30 people and expanded across 6 countries. We have around 80% of our team being engineers and have been working together for almost 3 years. We’re constantly looking for new opportunities to grow and expand existing relationships with protocols we currently support.
